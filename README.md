OpenDJ SDK
==========
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/OpenIdentityPlatform/OpenDJ-SDK.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/OpenIdentityPlatform/OpenDJ-SDK)

## How-to build

* git clone --recursive  https://github.com/OpenIdentityPlatform/OpenDJ-SDK.git
* mvn clean install -f OpenDJ-SDK

About
==========

The **OpenDJ LDAP SDK** provides a set of modern, developer-friendly Java APIs as part of the
[OpenDJ](http://opendj.forgerock.org) product suite, which is actively maintained and supported by
[ForgeRock](http://www.forgerock.com). The product suite includes the client SDK alongside command-line tools and
sample code, a 100% pure Java directory server, and more. You can use **OpenDJ SDK** to create client applications
for use with any server that complies with the
[RFC 4510: LDAP - Technical Specification Road Map](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4510).

The **OpenDJ LDAP SDK** brings you easy-to-use connection management, connection pooling, load balancing, and all the
standard LDAP operations to read and write directory entries. **OpenDJ LDAP SDK** also lets you build applications with
capabilities defined in additional draft and experimental RFCs that are supported by modern LDAP servers.

Documentation
=============

Javadoc for this module can be found [here](http://opendj.forgerock.org/opendj-core/apidocs/index.html). Read the
[developer guide](http://opendj.forgerock.org/doc/dev-guide/index.html) for a deeper understanding of LDAP application
development, as well as a detailed overview of LDAP itself.

Get the OpenDJ LDAP SDK
=======================

You can start developing your LDAP applications now by obtaining the **OpenDJ LDAP SDK** using any of the following
methods:

Maven
-----

By far the simplest method is to develop your application using Maven and add the following settings to your pom.xml:

```xml
<repositories>
  <repository>
    <id>forgerock-staging-repository</id>
    <name>ForgeRock Release Repository</name>
    <url>http://maven.forgerock.org/repo/releases</url>
    <snapshots>
      <enabled>false</enabled>
    </snapshots>
  </repository>
  <repository>
    <id>forgerock-snapshots-repository</id>
    <name>ForgeRock Snapshot Repository</name>
    <url>http://maven.forgerock.org/repo/snapshots</url>
    <releases>
      <enabled>false</enabled>
    </releases>
  </repository>
</repositories>
```

The following dependencies will load both the [OpenDJ Core APIs](opendj-core) and the [OpenDJ Grizzly](opendj-grizzly)
network transport. Remember to override the version according to your needs:

```xml
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>org.forgerock.opendj</groupId>
    <artifactId>opendj-core</artifactId>
    <version>3.0.0</version>
  </dependency>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>org.forgerock.opendj</groupId>
    <artifactId>opendj-grizzly</artifactId>
    <version>3.0.0</version>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

In some use-cases, such as developing LDAP unit tests or embedded LDAP applications, the network transport is not
required, in which case you can simply declare a dependency on the OpenDJ core APIs:

```xml
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>org.forgerock.opendj</groupId>
    <artifactId>opendj-core</artifactId>
    <version>3.0.0</version>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

Build it yourself
-----------------

You need `git` and `maven` in order to get the source code and build it:

```bash
git clone ssh://git@stash.forgerock.org:7999/opendj/opendj-sdk.git
cd opendj-sdk
mvn clean install
```

Getting started
===============

The following example shows how the **OpenDJ LDAP SDK** may be used to connect to a Directory Server, authenticate, and
then perform a search. The search results are output as LDIF to the standard output:

```java
// Create an LDIF writer which will write the search results to stdout.
final LDIFEntryWriter writer = new LDIFEntryWriter(System.out);

// Connect and bind to the server.
final LDAPConnectionFactory factory = new LDAPConnectionFactory(hostName, port);
final Connection connection = factory.getConnection();
connection.bind(userName, password.toCharArray());

// Read the entries and output them as LDIF.
final ConnectionEntryReader reader = connection.search(baseDN, scope, filter, attributes);
while (reader.hasNext()) {
    if (!reader.isReference()) {
        final SearchResultEntry entry = reader.readEntry();
        writer.writeComment("Search result entry: " + entry.getName());
        writer.writeEntry(entry);
    } else {
        final SearchResultReference ref = reader.readReference();
        writer.writeComment("Search result reference: " + ref.getURIs());
    }
}
writer.flush();
connection.close();
```
